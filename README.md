  this game has very simple rules , you have two types of scores : <br>
  1-temp score <br>
  2-final score <br>
  the first one is your score that resets every hour and it is transferd to your final score<br>
  while it is held you can use 10 points to cheat in a game in order to gain more points :D<br>
  in every game session you at each step you can choose a column and the lowest point will be yours,<br>
  although you can spend 10 points of your temp score and say which x (row) you want your point be<br>
  also the person who starts the game should make the first move , and you should always wait for other player to make theire move <br>

  how it works :<br>
